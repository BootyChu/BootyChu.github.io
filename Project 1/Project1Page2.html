      <p>Scientific analysis has shown that the Moeraki Boulders are made up of mud, fine silt and clay, cemented together by calcite. The boulders interestingly have a hollow core. Some of the rocks have strange cracks, known as septaria. The cracks have been filled with small amounts of dolomite and quartz as well as brown and yellow calcite, giving the boulders their distinctive appearance.</p>

<p style="font-size:11px;">The boulders are grey-colored septarian concretions, which have been exhumed from the mudstone enclosing them and concentrated on the beach by coastal erosion. Around a third of the boulders range in size from 0.5 to 1.0m in diameter, while the other two thirds range in size from 1.5 to 2.2m.

Although unusual, the Moeraki Boulders are not the only of their kind in the country. Practically identical spherical boulders, named the “Koutu Boulders”, are found on the beaches, cliffs and beneath the surface inland of the shore of Hokianga (Wikipedia Article) Harbour in the North Island. A number of similar boulders are also found on Shag Point, around 19km south of the Moeraki Boulders. The Shag Point boulders are unique for their concretions containing the bones of dinosaur-like marine reptiles. Similar spherical boulders have also been found in North Dakota, USA, and in Ontario, Canada.</p>

The cracks have been filled with small amounts of dolomite and quartz as well as brown and yellow calcite, giving the boulders their distinctive appearance.

The boulders were formed by the cementation of Paleocene mudstone in the Moeraki Formation. The main body of boulders started forming in what was then marine mud. The larger boulders are estimated to have taken 4 to 5.5 million years to grow, while 10 to 50m of marine mud accumulated on the seafloor above them.

There are currently over 50 boulders on the beach, the largest weighing around 7 tons. Waves continue to erode the mudstone of the area, made up of local bedrock and landslides, which means that embedded boulders are often exposed, resulting in “new” boulders.</p>
